<h1>About Me - Siddharth Sarvoday</h1>
<p>My career has been defined by a unique ability to bridge the gap between 
  complex financial reporting and cutting-edge technical solutions, 
  a skill set I have refined at industry-leading firms like Citco, State Street, 
  and Cognizant.</p>

<p>Currently, as a Team Leader at Citco Group Services, 
  I lead Interface Solutions and Outbound Reporting. My role is twofold:
   managing high-performing teams and driving Operational 
   Excellence through technical development. I have successfully architected 
   solutions using Python, SQL, and Power Platforms, and developed robust RPA 
   workflows using UiPath and Alteryx. By integrating Excel Macros/VBA with SQL 
   Databases, I have significantly enhanced data administration and reporting 
   accuracy for complex global interfaces.</p>

<p>Prior to Citco, I spent six years at State Street, 
  where I served as an Assistant Manager and a core member of the 
  Global Automation Services (GMAS) team. I have a proven 
  track record of:</p>
  
  <p>
  •	Process Automation: Reducing manual 
  overhead by developing custom applications in Power Apps, 
  Power Automate, Power BI, Python, C#, HTML, CSS & Java scripts, 
  Views & Stylesheets (.xml, .xslt), Excel VBA  Macros and MS Access.</p>

  <p> •	Operational Leadership: Managing end-to-end Fund Accounting, Collateral 
    Management, and Equity Portfolio operations.</p>
 
  <p>  •	Technical Integration: Implementing CI/CD pipelines using GitLab 
    and Azure to streamline development lifecycles.
  </p>

  <p>My foundation in MBA Finance and my early experience at Cognizant in
     Global Reconciliation (GRU) allow me to understand the "why" behind the data, 
     ensuring that every automation I build is strategically aligned with 
     business goals and risk mitigation.
  </p>

  <p>I am eager to bring my techno-functional expertise and help drive digital transformation within your operations. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my technical skills and leadership experience can contribute to your team's success.
    Sincerely,</p>

  <p>Siddharth Krishna Sarvoday</p>
